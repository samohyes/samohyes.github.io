We know that in the AndroidManifest.xml we can set some properties for service,activities and so on. There is one important property for an activity which is “android:exported”. If we set it to be true, the activity will be exposed to the cracker. Let’s take a look.

I created an app with two activities. One is MyActivity and the other one is welcome. First, set the AndroidManifest.xml file to this.

Run the app and use drozer to check the two activities.

What we see here is one activity. But if we change the exported property to true. Things will be different.

We got two exported activities now and the drozer can detect all of them. We can now actually start the welcome activity in the drozer without click the button in the MyActivity.
